## Motivation

The less input you have to give, the better. Every second spent controlling the app is time you could be spending on your work or just living your life. This Pomodoro timer doesn't have a pause button on purpose. If you need to take a break, just step away from your computer and let the timer keep running.

There's no tracking of stats or pressure to follow the timer exactly. It's just a helpful tool, not a strict boss. When you're ready to get back, just hit one of the hotkeys to start a new session.

Most Pomodoro apps come with tons of settings, menus, ads, and features you don't need. This timer keeps things simple and clean so it helps you stay focused without getting in the way.
